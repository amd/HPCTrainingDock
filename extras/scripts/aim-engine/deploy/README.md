# Deploying AIM

`aim_deploy.sh` deploys AIM into an existing cluster, one level at a time. The
levels form a ladder: a higher level assumes less is installed and does more,
and each preflights its preconditions before acting. We pick a level with
`--level`; the script dispatches to the building-block scripts below.

```bash
./aim_deploy.sh --level 1         # base-image serve, no operator
./aim_deploy.sh --level 4         # install prerequisites + AIM Engine, then serve
```

Each level has a usage guide covering how to run it and use the served model:

- [Level 1: base-image serve](level-1.md), no operator.
- [Level 2: operator serve](level-2.md), on a cluster that already has AIM Engine.
- [Level 3: install the operator, then serve](level-3.md).
- [Level 4: install prerequisites and the operator, then serve](level-4.md).

## Which level do I want

| Situation | Level |
| --- | --- |
| Prove a cluster's GPU serves a model, with nothing installed | 1 |
| AIM Engine and its prerequisites are already installed; we only submit workloads | 2 |
| The prerequisites are managed for us, but installing the operator is our job | 3 |
| We own a fresh cluster and install everything ourselves | 4 |

Level 2 is the common case on a managed cluster, including a laptop with a
kubeconfig for a cluster an administrator already set up; level 4 is turnkey for
a cluster we own; level 3 is the increment between them; level 1 is a separate
no-operator flow for a first-contact GPU check.

## Supplying a kubeconfig

From a machine not already pointed at the cluster, first set `KUBECONFIG` to the
path of the kubeconfig an administrator gave us, substituting our own path for
the placeholder below. We then confirm the variable is set and resolves to a
real file before running anything, since a wrong path leaves `kubectl` falling
back to `localhost:8080` and reporting the cluster as unreachable:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/kubeconfig
echo "${KUBECONFIG}"; test -s "${KUBECONFIG}" && echo "kubeconfig found" || echo "set KUBECONFIG to a real file"
```

Exporting it once means our own later `kubectl` commands inherit it too. To pass
it per run instead, all four scripts accept `--kubeconfig`, which exports
`KUBECONFIG` for that run and is inherited by the setup scripts (they show it
under `--help`):

```bash
./aim_deploy.sh --level 4 --kubeconfig /path/to/your/kubeconfig
```

A kubeconfig that authenticates through an OIDC provider (common on managed
clusters) runs an exec credential plugin such as `kubectl oidc-login`, which
needs the kubelogin plugin installed on `PATH` as `kubectl-oidc_login`. The
first `kubectl` call then performs a browser login: on a headless host we open
the URL it prints manually, or add `--grant-type=authcode-keyboard` to the
kubeconfig's exec args to paste the returned code back instead. Without the
plugin, `kubectl` cannot obtain a token and the scripts report that the cluster
is unreachable.

The token expires after a while, so an occasional re-login is normal. When it
lapses, the next `kubectl` call (including a script's first one) blocks waiting
for a fresh browser login, which on a headless host looks like a silent hang.
If a run seems to stall before printing anything, refresh the login by running
`kubectl get nodes` on its own (complete the browser step) and then re-run. As a
safeguard, the deploy applies objects server-side and retries transient failures,
so if an OIDC control plane ever rejects an occasional request with
`Unauthorized`, a run rides over it rather than failing.

## Choosing a namespace

On a multi-tenant cluster we must have access to a project and pass its name as
the namespace with `--namespace`, or the deploy will not work. Our identity is
usually authorized only in that project's namespace, not `default`, but the
scripts default to `default`, so a run without `--namespace` fails while
retrieving or creating objects even though `kubectl get nodes` and `kubectl get
ns` succeed: cluster-scoped reads are allowed but namespaced writes are not, and
some clusters report the denial as `Unauthorized` rather than `Forbidden`. Find
a namespace we can deploy into and pass it with `--namespace`:

```bash
for ns in $(kubectl get ns -o name | cut -d/ -f2); do
   kubectl auth can-i create deployments -n "$ns" >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "can deploy in: $ns"
done
./aim_deploy.sh --level 1 --keep 1 --namespace <namespace>
```

If nothing prints, our identity has no namespace yet and an administrator must
grant one. If a namespace exists but access is still denied, its RoleBinding may
name an identity (an email or a group) that differs from the one the API server
derives from our token's OIDC claims, which is a cluster-side fix rather than a
kubeconfig change.

## Forwarded options and tokens

`aim_deploy.sh` forwards a level's flags to its underlying script: `--keep` and
`--verbose` to `aim_base_check.sh` on level 1; `--replace`, `--aim-version`,
`--crds-chart`, and `--chart` to `aim_engine_setup.sh` on levels 3 and 4 (for
example `./aim_deploy.sh --level 3 --replace 1`). The default models are ungated,
so no token is needed; a gated model such as Llama or Gemma needs `HF_TOKEN`
exported.

## Model catalog

The AIM catalog is AMD's set of prebuilt, pre-tuned inference containers, one
per model, published on Docker Hub under `amdenterpriseai/aim-*` and browsable at
the [AMD Enterprise AI catalog](https://enterprise-ai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/aims/catalog/models.html).
Each image bundles the model plus validated profiles (tuned runtime settings) for
the discrete Instinct GPUs, so the operator can pick optimal parameters for our
hardware automatically. The deploy default (`AIM_MODEL_IMAGE`,
`amdenterpriseai/aim-qwen-qwen3-32b:0.13.0`) is one such catalog image; serve a
different one on levels 2 to 4 with `--model-image`:

```bash
./aim_deploy.sh --level 2 --namespace "$NAMESPACE" --model-image amdenterpriseai/aim-deepseek-ai-deepseek-r1:0.13.0
```

On a cluster that already has AIM Engine, the operator republishes the catalog as
cluster-scoped `AIMClusterModel` objects, so we list what *this* cluster offers
(rather than the full public catalog) with:

```bash
kubectl get aimclustermodels
```

## Customizing runtime parameters

Levels 2 to 4 (the operator path) are the lever for tuning. The image's profile
sets runtime parameters automatically, and we override per service through
`spec.profileOverrides.engineArgs`, which shallow-merges over the profile and is
passed verbatim to the inference-engine CLI (vLLM today, but the field is
engine-agnostic, so the context window is `max-model-len`), and `spec.env` for
environment variables. This works for any catalog model.

The deploy bakes overrides in for us, so they survive re-runs (which regenerate
the `AIMService`). For scalar engine args, `--max-model-len` sets the context
window and `--engine-arg KEY=VALUE` (repeatable, or the space-separated
`AIM_ENGINE_ARGS` env var) passes any other; both feed
`spec.profileOverrides.engineArgs`. For a 16k context with a memory cap:

```bash
./aim_deploy.sh --level 2 --namespace "$NAMESPACE" \
  --max-model-len 16384 --engine-arg gpu-memory-utilization=0.9
```

Those shortcuts only cover scalar `key=value` engine args. For engine args that
are flags or take list/object values, and for any other `spec` field — `env`,
`resources`, `replicas`, `profileOverrides.containerEnv`, adapters, autoscaling —
pass `--overrides-file`, a YAML merge patch applied over the generated
`AIMService` on every run (`engineArgs` is `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields`,
so it accepts arbitrarily typed values here). Merge semantics are RFC 7386: nested maps merge by
key; lists and scalars replace wholesale. For example, `overrides.yaml`:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 2
  env:
  - name: VLLM_USE_V1
    value: "1"
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 200Gi
```

```bash
./aim_deploy.sh --level 2 --namespace "$NAMESPACE" --overrides-file overrides.yaml
```

To change an already-running service without redeploying, patch it directly
instead (a later `aim_deploy.sh` run overwrites this, so prefer the flags above
for anything durable):

```bash
kubectl patch aimservice aim-smoke -n "$NAMESPACE" --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"profileOverrides":{"engineArgs":{"max-model-len":"16384"}}}}'
```

Tensor-parallel size (GPUs per replica) is `AIM_ACCELERATOR_COUNT` on the deploy
(it sets both the profile selector and the GPU resource), and replicas scale with
`spec.replicas`. Level 1 has none of this: it runs the container as a plain
Deployment with no profile machinery, so customization is limited to whatever
environment variables the image honors. Use level 1 for a first-contact GPU check
and levels 2 to 4 when we want tuned, managed serving.

## Building-block scripts

`aim_deploy.sh` is a thin wrapper over three scripts we can also run directly:

- `aim_engine_setup.sh`: preflights the eight prerequisites and, if they pass,
  Helm-installs the AIM Engine CRDs and operator, else exits 42 listing the gaps.
  Needs a reachable cluster, cluster-admin, and `kubectl` and `helm`; no local
  GPU. Level 3 calls it, level 4 with `--install-prereqs 1`.
- `aim_prereqs_setup.sh`: installs the seven add-ons AIM depends on
  (cert-manager, Gateway API, kgateway, KServe, KEDA, keda-otel-add-on, and the
  OpenTelemetry Operator). The AMD GPU Operator is assumed present. On shared
  clusters these are usually admin-managed, so we run this mainly on self-managed
  or test clusters.
- `aim_base_check.sh`: runs an AIM as a plain Deployment plus Service (not an
  `AIMService`), requests one GPU, and confirms a single request. Ungated by
  default, cleans up unless `--keep 1`. It matches the operator only on the
  runtime, not its label-driven profile resolution, so a pass is necessary but
  not sufficient. See [level 1](level-1.md).

## Verifying a level

Each level prints how to confirm it worked: the model answers a request and the
GPU is in use. Level 1 checks both automatically; levels 2 to 4 print commands
to watch the `AIMService` and `InferenceService` reach Ready, run an inference,
and check GPU use. One rule holds everywhere: vLLM registers the model under its
real id (the image or Hugging Face repo name), not the `AIMService` name, so we
read the id from `/v1/models` rather than hardcoding it.

## Known limits

- Profile resolution matches node labels the GPU Operator stamps
  (`aim-accelerator.<MODEL>` and `aim-accelerator.partitioning-scheme.default`,
  AND-ed by the v1alpha2 resolver) and succeeds only if the image ships a profile
  for that GPU. Profiles target discrete Instinct GPUs (MI300X, MI325X, MI350X,
  MI355X), so an MI300A APU has none and is not expected to serve.
- The default models (for example Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B) are
  ungated convenience picks: they exercise the serving path only and are not
  representative for benchmarking.
- The operator requires at least an optimized (pre-tuned) profile by default,
  which is a property of the model's catalog entry, not the GPU, so a community
  model can report `ProfileNotFound` even on capable hardware. We set
  `spec.profile.selector.minimumType: any` to allow a generic profile; raise it
  back to `optimized` to require tuned ones.
- The operator's cache PVC is ReadWriteMany so replicas share one copy of the
  weights, and routing needs a Gateway or load balancer. A ReadWriteOnce default
  (such as local-path) leaves the PVC Pending and the service in Starting, so the
  operator path needs an RWX StorageClass (NFS, CephFS, or Longhorn) and a load
  balancer, which we assume the cluster provides. The
  [test harness](../test/README.md) supplies both with an in-cluster NFS
  provisioner.
- KServe runs in Standard mode (`RawDeployment`), not the Knative-backed
  Serverless default, since the prerequisites ship Gateway API and kgateway.
  Override with `KSERVE_DEPLOYMENT_MODE`.
- A generated profile can omit a memory request, so KServe applies its `2Gi`
  default and the predictor is OOM-killed as it loads weights. We set an explicit
  `spec.resources` floor (overridable via `AIM_CPU_REQUEST`, `AIM_MEM_REQUEST`,
  `AIM_CPU_LIMIT`, and `AIM_MEM_LIMIT`). AIM Engine replaces the resource maps
  wholesale rather than deep-merging, so `spec.resources` must restate every key
  including `amd.com/gpu` (set to `AIM_ACCELERATOR_COUNT`); omitting it drops the
  GPU limit, the pod gets no isolated device, and in-container `rocminfo` then
  sees every host GPU and fails.
- The service controller does not always re-queue an `AIMService` when its
  `AIMProfileCache` reaches Ready, so it can sit in `Starting` with `READY False`
  and reason `Progressing` even though the weight download has finished. This is
  an operator bug we track upstream. `aim_deploy.sh` runs a detached watcher that
  forces a reconcile (an annotation bump) until the service moves past the stall,
  gating only on the `AIMService`'s own conditions so it still works for a
  namespaced identity that cannot read the cache object (disable with
  `AIM_AUTO_NUDGE=0`). If the watcher is not running (the deploy shell exited, or
  we applied the `AIMService` by hand) and a service stays `Progressing` after the
  download completes, we clear it with one manual nudge:

  ```bash
  kubectl annotate aimservice aim-smoke -n "$NAMESPACE" kick="$(date +%s)" --overwrite
  ```
