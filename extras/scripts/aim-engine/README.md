# AIM Engine deployment and testing

These scripts install and serve models with AMD's AIM (AMD Inference
Microservices) Engine, a Kubernetes (k8s) operator for serving models on AMD
GPUs. We deploy a cluster-scoped operator (Custom Resource Definitions plus a
Helm chart) through `kubectl` and `helm`; there is no Lmod module. The scripts
target a cluster that already exists and do not provision one: provisioning from
bare metal is the job of the AMD Enterprise AI reference stack (see References),
of which AIM Engine is one component.

An AIM is the inference container that serves one model and self-selects
optimized runtime parameters for the hardware; AIM Engine is the operator that
manages those containers at scale. We run an AIM directly at level 1 and drive
AIM Engine at levels 2 to 4.

## Layout

- [`deploy/`](deploy/README.md): the `aim_deploy.sh` entrypoint, its three
  building-block scripts, and a per-level usage guide. This is what we run
  against a real cluster, from a login node or a laptop holding its kubeconfig.
- [`test/`](test/README.md): `aim_engine_test.sh`, which stands up a disposable
  `kind` cluster with real AMD GPU passthrough, runs the `deploy/` scripts on it
  end to end, and discards everything on exit.
- [`rocbudai/`](rocbudai/README.md): a thin client that points AMD-HPC's
  [rocBudAI](https://github.com/AMD-HPC/rocBudAI) profiling assistant (an
  opencode TUI) at a model already served by `deploy/`, instead of running one
  locally with ollama. Consumes the served `/v1` endpoint and ships an optional
  `module load rocbudai` experience.

## Test first

We recommend a harness run before deploying for real. It is the closest
rehearsal available, because it runs the same `deploy/` scripts: in interactive
mode it hands us the same `aim_deploy.sh --level N` commands we run in
production. It only substitutes the foundation a real cluster already provides:
the cluster itself (`kind` with `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri` passthrough), the
`amd.com/gpu` advertisement and accelerator labels a GPU Operator would stamp,
and a ReadWriteMany StorageClass (an in-cluster NFS provisioner) for shared
storage. A green run therefore confirms the scripts, the operator install, and
GPU-backed inference. The caveat is scale: it is a single `kind` node, so it
validates flow correctness, not capacity. See [`test/README.md`](test/README.md)
for the modes, including a Kubernetes-free path for hosts without Docker or
`cgroup` v2.

## Prerequisites

- Deploy: `kubectl` and `helm` on `PATH`, and a cluster whose GPU nodes run the
  AMD GPU Operator. Installing cluster-scoped components needs cluster-admin. A
  kubeconfig that authenticates through OIDC also needs the kubelogin plugin (see
  [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md)).
- Test: a GPU host with `docker` and the `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri` devices;
  `kind`, `kubectl`, and `helm` are fetched as user-local binaries if absent.
